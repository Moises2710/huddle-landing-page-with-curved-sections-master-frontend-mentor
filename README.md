## Overview

This is a project of Frontend Mentor Page, I started this project on Friday, February 23, 2024, and finished it on the 28th of that same month and year.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

This is my second project of Frontend Mentor and, I start to layout the HTML with my knowledge and after I start to add to CSS, I had very difficult in the footer section because I don't really understand how to place the paragraphs, plus the social media icons were a headache, but I was able to do it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learn a lot of things in this project, The most important is web design, My knowledge on that topic was very little...to this day it still is but I have much more knowledge now, another issue is adding CSS to the textarea tag which I had never tried. I don't really understand what an SVG image was until I saw the logo code in vs code, I didn't understand how to change the color of the logo to place it in the footer, the only thing I had to do was duplicate it, change the name with logo-white and change the color to #fff within your code. I like it this project.

### Continued development

Definitely web design, I could do better this Frontend Mentor projects with web design, This is the main topic I want to focus on.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://es.stackoverflow.com/questions/371148/como-le-quito-borde-cuando-seleccion-input-text) - This link very help me because I didn't know how to add styles to a textarea. 
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - This article of MDN is very well, It's about everything related to web design.
